/app/calendar/id/day/date - so add /day

| DESIGN

inconsistent width of buttons: some are full width on mobile, most not.

| BUGS

when editing event is finished in week view, it should go back to week view
same with new events.

when events from invitations overlap, the UI is a bit
confusing, in particular if the two evengs have same color.
and there is no validation at all.
